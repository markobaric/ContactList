Create a single page web application which will be used as phone book or contact list. Functionalities should be similar to a phone book on a smartphone.

Application must have the following features:
- Creating, deleting and editing of contacts
- Each contact can have following properties:
	- First Name
	- Last Name
	- Address
	- List of phone numbers
	- List of email addresses
	- List of tags
- Contacts can be searched by First Name, Last Name or any of the Tags
- Searching must be performed on the server, not on the client. This means that only contacts that meet the search criteria will be retreived from the server.
- Contacts can be bookmarked in browser and back/forward browser buttons must be supported
- Application is intended to be used by a single user (no login page, user handling, sessions, etc.)

Frontent should be implemented with AngularJS and backend with ASP.NET WebAPI. Data should be persisted in SQL Server database.
